# Fruits and Vegetables Recognition 🍎🥕

This project implements an image classification system for identifying fruits and vegetables. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification, it provides accurate predictions for a range of fruits and vegetables. The project also features a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for real-time image uploads and predictions.

## Usage 🚀

### Running the Streamlit Application
To launch the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This opens the web application in your default browser, where you can:
- Upload an image.
- View the predicted label (fruit/vegetable name).
- Explore an engaging interface with real-time predictions.

### Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, open the `fruits-and-vegetables-classification.ipynb` notebook and follow these steps:
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it for training.
2. Define and compile a CNN model architecture.
3. Train and evaluate the model on the training and validation datasets.
4. Save the trained model as `cnn_model.h5` for deployment.

## Project Architecture 🏗️

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Images are resized and normalized.
   - Split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A CNN is defined with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
   - The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

3. **Model Deployment**:
   - The trained model is integrated into the Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

4. **Frontend Interface**:
   - Streamlit provides a lightweight yet powerful web app to upload and classify images interactively.
